# LazyMouseAndKeyboard

The goal of this project is to be able to control the mouse and keyboard
in basic ways, from a remote device such as a smartphone or tablet.

The idea of this project will be to have a Node.js server running on the
computer that is to be controlled, and the client will be a browser based
interface that allows the user to move the mouse, click the mouse, scroll,
and enter text, without requiring any installation on the client device.

Project Motivation:

I personally use my laptop connected with an HDMI cable to my TV to stream
video, and I am looking for a convenient way to control the laptop without
moving from the couch. I find having a wireless mouse and keyboard with me
to be a bit annoying, as they take up space and I sometimes forget to bring
it to the couch, but I always have my phone on me.
